I am a Computer Science Engineering student with an interest in Full Stack Web Development.
I like building responsive, user-friendly websites and learning through practical, real-world projects.

This portfolio features projects developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on clean UI design and responsive layouts.# RAYPORT
